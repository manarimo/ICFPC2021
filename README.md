## Solvers
* mkut was an extremetly sophisticated neural-network based solver that mainly solved problems which were known to be able to achieve dislike of 0.
* amylase/bruteforce: our first automated solver. returns an optimal solution for small problems.
* amylase/manten: an specialized solver for zero dislike problems. manten means full-score in Japanese.
* kawatea/simulated_annealing.cpp: runs simulated annealing to optimze the placement of vertices.

## Submission
* amylase/package_solutions: Resolve bonus dependencies and maximize expected ranking point using Integer Programming solver.
